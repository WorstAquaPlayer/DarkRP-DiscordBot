# DarkRP DiscordBot
## Overview
Discord bot written with [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) that provides information about the available jobs and shipments in a DarkRP server.<br/>
It does this by parsing a given jobs.lua and shipments.lua files.<br/>
This bot was designed to work with a specific [DarkRP](https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/gmod.clan-gameover.com:27016/) server, but it can be easily repurposed for another servers.
## Important
Remember to read the README at the Resources folder, since the files in there are required for the bot to work.
